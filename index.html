					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<img id="MyPic">
						<p>My name is Stuart Schafer and I am a creator. I am an only child, but when I was 11 I had a brother named <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000" target="_blank">Tandy 1000</a></strong>. Tandy and myself made computer games together. In school, I first studied Industrial Technology and created things with my hands using metal, plastics, and wood. I then studied Mechanical Engineering and created things with my calculator using paper and pencil. Now I create things with my computer using 0's and 1's. I have created many applications that showcase what I can do.</p>
						<p>I have lived my entire life in the state of North Carolina.  I was born in Fayetteville, NC, aka <strong><a href="http://rapradar.com/2009/07/24/jcole-speaks-on-fayettenam/" target="_blank">Fayet-nam</a></strong>, Fay-Ruit, and Bragg-dad. I went to school at <strong><a href="http://www.appstate.edu/" target="_blank">Appalachian State</a></strong> in Boone, NC, and then UNC Charlotte.  I met my wonderful, beautiful, smart, amazing, talented, gorgeous wife in Charlotte, NC, and we were married on my birthday (I better not forget our anniversary!).</p>
						<p>Iâ€™ve worked in Charlotte for the past 17 years mostly in inside sales, tech support, and customer service.  We moved to Cary for a great job opportunity for my wife, and I went back to school to pursue my passion; computer coding.  I recently finished school and have created many elaborate applications, from front-end to back-end, I can code full-stack applications.  Please visit my <strong><a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a></strong> for more insight on my creations.</p>
						<p>We have 2 furry critters that run our house:	<strong><a href="assets/images/socksandbuffy.jpg" target="_blank">Socks (L) and Buffy (R)</a></strong>. (click on them to see a picture)</p>
