					<h3>About Me</h3>
						<img id="MyPic">
						<p>My name is Stuart Schafer, unless I’m in trouble or did something wrong.  In that case, my name is Rudy Gesegnet. I have lived my entire life in the state of North Carolina.  I was born in Fayetteville, NC, aka Fayet-nam, Fay-Ruit, and Bragg-dad. I went to school at Appalachian State in Boone, NC, and then UNC Charlotte.  I met my wonderful, beautiful, smart, amazing, talented, gorgeous wife in Charlotte, NC, and we were married on my birthday (I better not forget our anniversary!).</p>
						<p>I’ve worked in Charlotte for the past 17 years mostly in inside sales, tech support, and customer service.  We moved to Cary for a great job opportunity for my wife, and I went back to school to pursue my passion; computer coding.  I recently finished school and created many elaborate applications, from front-end to back-end, I can code full-stack applications.  Please visit my portfolio for more insight on my creations.</p>
						<p>We have 2 furry critters that run our house:	<a href="assets/images/socksandbuffy.jpg">Socks (L) and Buffy (R)</a>. (click on them to see a picture)</p>
